    "text": "Interests\n\n\n Reading is one of my biggest passions, and whether it’s fiction or non-fiction, I find myself constantly seeking new stories and knowledge. I’ve built up a collection of over 600 books, and it keeps growing. I also collect bookmarks from various places, which adds a bit of fun to my reading experience. When I’m not reading a physical book, I’m often listening to audiobooks or podcasts (especially, This Podcast Will Kill You), enjoying the freedom to take in new content while on the move.\n\nMore recently, I’ve also picked up embroidery and crochet, dabbling in these crafts when I want to unwind and get creative. It’s a fun, hands-on way to relax and add a little more art to my life.\n\nTraveling and hiking are other activities I enjoy, especially the chance to explore new places and immerse myself in nature. It’s a great way to disconnect and recharge. These hobbies are not just about relaxation; they give me a fresh perspective and a break from the usual pace of my scientific work, helping me come back with a clearer mind and renewed focus."
