    "text": "Interests\n\n Reading is one of my biggest passions, and whether it’s fiction or non-fiction, I find myself constantly seeking new stories and knowledge. I’ve built up a collection of over 600 books, and it keeps growing. I also collect bookmarks from various places, which adds a bit of fun to my reading experience. When I’m not reading a physical book, I’m often listening to audiobooks or podcasts (especially, This Podcast Will Kill You), enjoying the freedom to take in new content while on the move.\n\nMore recently, I’ve also picked up embroidery and crochet, dabbling in these crafts when I want to unwind and get creative. It’s a fun, hands-on way to relax and add a little more art to my life.\n\nTraveling and hiking are other activities I enjoy, especially the chance to explore new places and immerse myself in nature. It’s a great way to disconnect and recharge. These hobbies are not just about relaxation; they give me a fresh perspective and a break from the usual pace of my scientific work, helping me come back with a clearer mind and renewed focus."

    "text": "Welcome to my website!\n\n\n\n  My name is Aishwarya Deengar, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University. I hold a Master’s in Bioinformatics from Boston University and another in Biomedical Sciences from Delhi University, combining both computational and wet-lab expertise in my research. My work spans multiomic single-cell sequencing, evolutionary analyses, and machine learning applications. I have hands-on experience from my three years at Ring Therapeutics, a viral vector-based gene therapy startup in Cambridge, MA, before joining Case. Skilled in R, Python, and various sequencing platforms, I am passionate about using bioinformatics and innovative research to uncover insights that advance our understanding of complex biological systems and their therapeutic potential.\n  In my free time, I love reading as well as collecting books. \n\n\n\n  Feel free to explore the sections to learn more about me!"
