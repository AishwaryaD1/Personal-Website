<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My name is Aishwarya Deengar, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics at Case Western Reserve University. I hold a Masterâ€™s in Bioinformatics from Boston University and another in Biomedical Sciences from Delhi University, combining both computational and wet-lab expertise in my research. My work spans multiomic single-cell sequencing, evolutionary analyses, and machine learning applications. I have hands-on experience from my three years at Ring Therapeutics, a viral vector-based gene therapy startup in Cambridge, MA, before joining Case. Skilled in R, Python, and various sequencing platforms, I am passionate about using bioinformatics and innovative research to uncover insights that advance our understanding of complex biological systems and their therapeutic potential.
  In my free time, I love reading as well as collecting books.
