## Interests

```{=html}
<p style="text-align: justify;">
 Reading is one of my biggest passions, and whether it’s fiction or non-fiction, I find myself constantly seeking new stories and knowledge. I’ve built up a collection of over 600 books, and it keeps growing. I also collect bookmarks from various places, which adds a bit of fun to my reading experience. When I’m not reading a physical book, I’m often listening to audiobooks or podcasts (especially, This Podcast Will Kill You), enjoying the freedom to take in new content while on the move.<br>

More recently, I’ve also picked up embroidery and crochet, dabbling in these crafts when I want to unwind and get creative. It’s a fun, hands-on way to relax and add a little more art to my life.<br>

Traveling and hiking are other activities I enjoy, especially the chance to explore new places and immerse myself in nature. It’s a great way to disconnect and recharge. These hobbies are not just about relaxation; they give me a fresh perspective and a break from the usual pace of my scientific work, helping me come back with a clearer mind and renewed focus.
